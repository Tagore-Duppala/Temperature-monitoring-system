# Temperature-monitoring-system
Generally in industries like pharmaceutical industries the temperature of the place needed to be specific an needed to notice immediately, if there is any problem.
But a person cannot sense the slight temperature change and neither cannot check the temperature levels all the time.
So this IoT enabled device comes in handy. It is simple but very useful in monitoring the temperature and alterting immediately when temperature crosses threshold by sending the message.
It uses Bolt Wifi module and bolt app to get the values from the LM35 temperature sensor and when the values crosses the threshold values it uses Twilio for sending messages.
