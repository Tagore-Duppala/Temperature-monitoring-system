# Temperature-monitoring-system
Generally in pharmaceutical industries the temperature of the place needed to be specific and needed to notice immediately, if there is any problem.
But a person cannot sense the slight temperature change and neither cannot check the temperature levels all the time.
So this IoT enabled device comes in handy. It is simple but very useful in monitoring the temperature and alterting immediately when temperature crosses threshold by sending the message.
It uses Bolt Wifi module to get the values from the LM35 temperature sensor and when the values crosses the threshold value it immediately turns on the buzzer and also uses Twilio for sending messages to the authorised numbers.
